Theme for WordPress main site
===================================
The main theme used to power the Team BlueRidge [website]. It's a full theme based on [the responsive theme], so not a child theme.
This allows us to add our own features and keep the best of the Responsive theme. The original repo can be found [here].

#Features
4 custom menu's, many page templates and a custom home page. What do you need more? The theme comes also with some very handy social footer icons and is responsive as well.


#License
The theme is licensed under GPLv3. This isn't applied to the logo, which is strictly owned by Team BlueRidge. A copy of the license is included.
